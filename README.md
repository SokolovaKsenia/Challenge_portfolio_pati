# Task 1. Software configuration.

## Subtask1.
* Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?
* Why did you decide to participate in the project?
* What was driving you? What is your goal?
* What are your expectations for the project?

## I'll say just a few words:

##### As the world of computer technology is developing very quickly, and I am a very creative person and I can't stand boring routine work,
##### I've decided to help to speed up this process even more. 
##### I've had learnt FrontEnd development before, and last year I've devoted my efforts to Manual QA and AQA, studying by myself and participating in internships at Ukrainian IT companies. 
##### From the project I expect to gain new knowledge, acquaintances and opportunities. 
##### The best ever goal for me - is to obtain a new interesting job in this area.

###### **_Thank you for the given ability to participate in this project and good luck:)_**
