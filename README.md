# Task 1. Software configuration.

## Subtask1.
* Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?
* Why did you decide to participate in the project?
* What was driving you? What is your goal?
* What are your expectations for the project?

## I just say a few words:

As the world of computer technology is developing very quickly, 
and I am a very creative person and I can't stand boring routine work.
I decided to help speed up this process even more. 
From the project I expect to gain new knowledge, acquaintances and opportunities.
Thank you for participating in this project and good luck:)
